# LampShade

This project was created to streamline the process of extraction-based text annotation. It is a tool used by my data acquisition team at QCRI, made open source. Feel free to submit issues, feedback, and requests for other features!

## Installation

This tool is easy to install and only runs in your browser. For installation, navigate to the root directory ('frontend') and simply run:
